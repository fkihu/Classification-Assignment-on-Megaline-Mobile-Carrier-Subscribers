# Classification-Assignment-on-Megaline-Mobile-Carrier-Subscribers
The task is to develop a model that helps Megaline Mobile Carrier pick the right plan for its subscribers

# Problem Statement
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans.
They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend
one of Megaline's newer plans: **Smart** or **Ultra.**
You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the
new plans. For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. 

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for
accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
1. Open and look through the data file.
2. Split the source data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
3. Investigate the quality of different models by changing hyperparameters. Briefly
describe the findings of the study.
4. Check the quality of the model using the test set.
5. Additional task: sanity check the model.
